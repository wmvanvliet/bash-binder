# Bash binder repository

LINK: [Start with
Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wmvanvliet/bash-binder/hideandseek?urlpath=terminals%2Fnew)

This repository does nothing other than produces a Bash shell using
mybinder.org: the link goes directly to a terminal.  It is useful for
courses and similar.


## Notes and development

- It seems that we can't link directly to a terminal using JupyterLab,
  so this uses classic notebook.
- Extra files for samples/demonstration can be added to this
  repository as needed.
